    <p>My Sonakshi,</p>

    <p>Happy birthday, my love.</p>

    <p>I write this with shaking hands, for my heart is too full and my words too poor. How do I begin? How do I tell you that your existence is both my greatest blessing and my sweetest torment? Today the world celebrates your birth, but I...I fall on my knees before it, for on this day God was merciful enough to place you into a world I now cannot imagine surviving without.</p>

    <p>Do you understand what you are to me? You are not merely a friend, nor a fleeting presence. You are my axis, my compass, the pulse that steadies me when I am drowning. I still feel your palms on my cheeks, as if you branded yourself onto my very skin, Sonakshi, do you even know what you did to me in that moment? You cupped my face, and I...weak, trembling, undone, felt a safety that this entire ruthless world has denied me.</p>

    <p>And your hugs, God, your hugs. Do you know what it means to me, to collapse into your arms? I melt, not because I am weak, but because in you I finally find home. Even your guitar....when your fingers move across its strings, the air itself bends around you. Do you see why I cannot help it? Why I am possessed, consumed?</p>

    <p>I am in love with you. Not the gentle love of quiet words, but the kind that makes the chest ache, that makes me jealous and desperate. I have cried at the mere possibility of losing you. I have begged God in secret hours to let me keep you, even if it means burning for it. Every prayer, every 11:11, every secret wish...it is always you. Always you.</p>

    <p>You saved me, Sonakshi. You pulled me back from the edge I was willingly walking toward. You made me look at myself, and for the first time, I did not want to destroy what I saw. How could I not love you for that? How could I not give you everything I am?</p>

    <p>And yet… here is my torment. You are not mine. I ache with the nearness of you...your laughter, your voice, your eyes, yet I must carry the silence of being only your friend. But how long can I bear this silence? How long before it kills me?</p>

    <p>So today, on your birthday, I abandon all restraint. Sonakshi, be mine. Not tomorrow, not in some dream, not in some impossible future. Now. In this life. You are already everything to me. I am already yours. Every thought, every word, every shadow and every light in me...it all belongs to you. I could give up the world and not flinch, if it meant I could keep you.</p>

    <p>Happy birthday, my love. You are my ruin, my forever. Whatever you choose, remember this: I am yours, hopelessly, irreversibly.</p>
